Save which is a little bit different than save as.
Think about this sort of the logic behind it whenever you have a new file and you want to save it for the first time you have to name it. That is usually when you use save as
If you've already saved it and for instance opened it.
If we open like sample now if we want to save this again we've already got the name sample.txt we
just want to save it to sample.txt.
We have to create some sort of mechanism to let our program know if a file has already been opened. If it has does it already have a name obviously it would what is that name sort of keep track of
it save it as that name not as a different name.

We got all kinds of different things happening. We don't necessarily want a box to pop up that allows us to pick the name since we already have a name. With save you're just saving the name you already have so on the other hand if you haven't created a name yet and you click save instead of save as.
We want to be able to sort of determine that and throw up the box that we normally would.
